## Testing Bob without the interactive examples repository

As mentioned above, this repository contains a couple of representative examples that you can use to test Bob. For most use cases, this should be enough and allow you to test your changes without installing BoB locally and integrating it with the interactive examples repository.

To test your changes, run:

```
npm start
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
MDN-BOB: Cleaning or creating ./docs/....
MDN-BOB: Copying static assets....
MDN-BOB: Compiling editor JavaScript....
MDN-BOB:  ../editor/js/editable-css-bundle.js written to disk
MDN-BOB:  ../editor/js/editable-js-bundle.js written to disk
MDN-BOB:  ../editor/js/editable-wat-bundle.js written to disk
MDN-BOB:  ../editor/js/editor-bundle.js written to disk
MDN-BOB: Pages built successfully
```

This will build the local examples and startup a local server serving the examples. Navigate to [localhost:4444](http://127.0.0.1:4444/) and open one of the examples to test your changes.

## Testing Bob as part of interactive examples

When working on changes to BoB, you might need to test against more examples than those that are a part of this repository. In those cases, you will need to run a local version of Bob inside the interactive-examples repo. Use the following command from the root of your local copy of the [interactive-examples](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples) repo:

```
npx install-local ~/path/to/bob && node node_modules/.bin/mdn-bob
```
